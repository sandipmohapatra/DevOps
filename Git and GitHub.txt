Git and GitHub:-
----------------------------
1)It is a latest and widly used distributed version control system.
example:- any software development we have certain version.1.0 to 5.5.
2)The different versions of the software are stored in the git.It is important because in every version the older s/w will be only modified.They will not start from the scrach.
3)Git helps to manage the project with high efficiency.
4)The version control system allows us to moniter and work together with our team members at the same workspace.
5)The git provides the main branch and sub branches.
Here the main branch indicates the final project.The sub branches indicates the team members.Daily they will upadate there subbranches and the team/module lead will merge these code to the main branch after testing.
6)we will conduct some operation in windows and some operation in Linux.
7) It is a open-source distributed version control system.It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency.
8)Git is secure,scalable,open source,speed and distributed application.
9)It provides branching and merging.Branching is used for indivisual developer and merging is done to the main stream.
example :- Main project is the bank.
		1)one member devloping login,registration pages
		2)second member developing developing loan processing page.
		3)third member developing applying for credit/debit card 
They will all merge to the main bank project.
10)every time we add ,modify or delete any data from the git ,we have to commit it.
11)It saves time,we can do offline works,undo mistakes and track changes. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Git is a local repository 
github is a global repository

To copy the uploaded files from github to local folder

github link :-https://github.com/sandipmohapatra/DevOps

commands :-
-----------------------
1)git remote add origin "https://github.com/sandipmohapatra/DevOps"

2)get pull origin master/main/mohapatra2018

3)git status :- see how many file are created in the local repository and ready to commit.

git --we have some files newly added,some files are modified.


4)git add :- lets you to add files to your index.

 git add devops.txt

git add .

5)git commit -m "This is a file from abc project"

6)git log :- to check all the activities

7)ls - to check the list of files.

8)create a branch
git branch firstbranch

9)to switch to firstbranch
 git checkout firstbranch

10)vi First.txt
Type
:wq


11)to see the content of the file
cat First.tx

12)ls :- to check the list of files.

13)to merge firstBranch to master
git checkout master
git merge firstbranch

master ---first.txt,second.txt,third.txt

firstbranch --fouth.txt,fifth.txt,six.txt

14)git commit -a -m "modified files"
all the files will be add to index and commit.

*merge is to add the difference.

15)create ssh key
ssh-keygen

16)to continue press (y)

17)goto setting at the top where you have profile and logout

18)goto SSH and GPG keys

19)ckick on new SSH key

20)copy the key and paste on the github

21)refresh the page

22)git push origin master
